**Manual Pseudocode**
*For the manual pseudocode, we expect you to provide a detailed paragraph outlining the steps you would take to manually test the signup form. Imagine you're using a test management tool like Zephyr or similar alternatives. You can structure your pseudocode with or without screenshots, focusing on evaluating the testing steps thoroughly. Include scenarios such as input field validation, functionality testing, login attempts with both valid and invalid credentials, and any other relevant test cases. The goal is to ensure comprehensive coverage of the signup form's functionality and usability.*
For the test scenarios for the login form, I have created a document of test scenarios written in the Gherkin Syntax. These scenarios cover the happy and sad path as well as including scenarios that ensure that format checking and validation are working correctly.
